# PrestoPronto
EXAFS analysis for long set of data 

The software PrestoPronto consist to a full graphical user interface (GUI) program aimed to execute the analysis of large X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy data sets. Written in Python, the algorithm has a practical and intuitive GUI, is free and open source. The code is able to read large datasets, apply calibration, alignment corrections and perform classical data analysis, from the extraction of the signal to EXAFS fit. The package includes GUIÂ´s to perform, on pre-process data, Principal Component Analysis and Linear Combination Fits. The main benefit of this program is allow to follow quickly the evolution of time resolved experiments coming from Quick-EXAFS (QEXAFS) and dispersive EXAFS beamlines
