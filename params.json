  "body": "### Prestopronto\r\n\r\nThe software PrestoPronto (from Italian “soon ready”) consist to a full graphical user interface (GUI) program aimed to execute the analysis of a large X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) data sets. Written in Python, the software has an intuitive GUI and can be run by source code (Windows, MAC, UNIX) or using a compiled version (in this case, only for Windows). It is free and open source software.\r\n\r\n![first](https://github.com/soonready/PrestoPronto/blob/gh-pages/images/prestopronto_new.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe code is able to read big dataset, apply calibration and alignment corrections, and perform classical data analysis, from the extraction to the EXAFS fit using as engine the code [Larch](http://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/). The package includes also GUI´s to perform Linear Combination Fit, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Iterative Target Transformation Factor Analysis (ITTFA), a procedure to align theoretical components obtained from PCA analysis to the experimentally measured. The main benefit of this code is allow to follow in real time the evolution of time- or space-resolved experiments coming from Quick-EXAFS (QEXAFS) and dispersive EXAFS beamlines. The present version the software adopted a flexible general input  method for ASCII files.\r\n\r\nThe parameter selection for XANES, EXAFS, and FT is interactive \r\n\r\n![exafs1](https://github.com/soonready/PrestoPronto/blob/gh-pages/images/EXAFS1.png)\r\n\r\n### Download Releases\r\nInstallation files could be download [here](https://github.com/soonready/PrestoPronto/releases)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCarmelo Prestipino (@Prestipino)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
