{"name":"Prestopronto","tagline":"EXAFS analysis for long set of data ","body":"### PRESTOPRONTO\r\nThe software PRESTOPRONTO (from Italian “soon ready”) consist to a full graphical user interface (GUI) program aimed to execute the analysis of a large X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) data sets. Written in Python, the software has an intuitive GUI and can be run by source code (Windows, MAC, UNIX) or using a compiled version (in this case, only for Windows). It is free and open source software. The code is able to read big dataset, apply calibration and alignment corrections, and perform classical data analysis, from the extraction to the EXAFS fit using as engine the code IFEFFIT. Includes also GUI´s to perform Linear Combination Fit, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Iterative Target Transformation Factor Analysis (ITTFA), a procedure to align theoretical components obtained from PCA analysis to the experimentally measured. The main benefit of this code is allow to follow in real time the evolution of time- or space-resolved experiments coming from Quick-EXAFS (QEXAFS) and dispersive EXAFS beamlines. The present version the software is able to open file from the follwing beamlines: ex-BM29, BM23, ID24(ESRF) and SAMBA(SOLEIL) or ascii files from a generic beamline. It is under development (more beamlines datafiles formats will be soon available, suggestions are very welcome).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Window installer \r\nwindow installer could be downloaded here [installer](https://github.com/soonready/PrestoPronto/tree/master/windows%20installer)\r\n\r\n### Python code \r\nPython cede is here [source](https://github.com/soonready/PrestoPronto)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
